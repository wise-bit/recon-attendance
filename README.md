 * Course Code:
 *      ICS4U1 - Period 5 - Semester 1
 *
 * Title:
 *      Reconattendance (A combination of reconnaissance and attendance)
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *
 *      Taking attendance at the beginning of a class is time-consuming, and can take quite long depending on the total
 *      population of the class. With the advent of facial recognition, it is a practical idea to use this to take attendance
 *      automatically when the students walk into the room.
 *
 *      This program does so without using any pre-existing libraries, but using an entirely new algorithm.
 *
 * Features:
 *
 *      In a nutshell, reconattendance's components include:
 *
 *      1. A program which is able to recognize when a face is in range of the camera.
 *      2. Allocate identification, or interest points on a recognized face in order to identify it.
 *      3. Compare the digital data with data in the database in order to check if they are in the database.
 *      4. Add the personâ€™s attendance status to the database automatically.
 *
 *
 *      (i) The program has an extremely unique method of recognition of facial recognition by primary treatment of images
 *      to enhance certain features. Therefore, this approach not only makes the existing features work better, but also allows
 *      future additions of more features of a face without too much effort. This makes the program very versatile.
 *
 *      (ii) All major features protected under a self-defined encryption system with a secure password to ensure students
 *      cannot change any major aspects of the program without teachers' supervision
 *
 *      (iii) Adding of further versions of a face over time to improve results.
 *
 *      (iv) A generally fully functional attendance app with or without the camera support, to a certain extent
 *
 *      (v) A new and innovative way of processing images and using them for training models and tweaking parameters
 *
 *
 * Major Skills:
 *
 *      (i) Object oriented programming - Teachers, Students, Classes, Faces
 *      (2) Image Processing - The whole project is based on image manipulation
 *      (3) Object comparisons
 *      (4) Mathematical innovation
 *      (5) Significant planning skills for development of new algorithms
 *
 *
 * Area of concern:
 *      (i) The program uses a Webcam library, which was impossible to be coded natively in Java, hence it is based on C
 *      code to access hardware. Although tested thoroughly, the webcam interface may fail in specific situations such
 *      as unsupported webcams, which is still fixable through minor tweakings
 *
 *      (ii) The algorithm used in this program is built from the ground up, from scratch. Therefore, it has very minimal
 *      training concerning machine learning, and the mathematical capabilities of the models are incomparable to other projects
 *      such as OpenCV. Therefore, the results may often be false.
 *
 *      (iii) Due to lack of time, the models were not trained well enough, but if given the chance, this program is capable
 *      of performing much better over time.
